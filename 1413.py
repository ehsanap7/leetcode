# Given an array nums. We define a running sum of an array as runningSum[i] = sum(nums[0]â€¦nums[i]).
from typing import List


# Complexity Analysis
#
# Time complexity: O(n)
# where n is the length of the input array.
# This is because we use a single loop that iterates over the entire array to calculate the running sum.
#
# Space complexity: O(1)
# since we don't use any additional space to find the running sum.
# Note that we do not take into consideration the space occupied by the output array.
